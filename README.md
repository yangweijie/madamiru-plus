## Installation
Download the executable for Windows, Linux, or Mac from the
[releases page](https://github.com/mtkennerly/madamiru/releases).
It's portable, so you can simply download it and put it anywhere on your system.

You'll also need to install [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download),
which is a framework that provides various video codecs.

If you prefer, Madamiru is also available via
[Winget, Flatpak, and Cargo](docs/help/installation.md).

Note:

* Windows users may see a popup that says
  "Windows protected your PC",
  because Windows does not recognize the program's publisher.
  Click "more info" and then "run anyway" to start the program.
* Mac users may see a popup that says
  "Madamiru can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer".
  To allow Madamiru to run, please refer to [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445),
  specifically the section on `If you want to open an app [...] from an unidentified developer`.
